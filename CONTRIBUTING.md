## Regading AI use

If you use AI, make sure you properly reviewed all the code. Make sure that the
generated code fits the style of the rest of the project. Remove unnecessary
comments and ensure that any documentation changes actually sound human and fit
with the style of the rest of the documentation of the project. This means in
100% of all cases that you have to edit documentation changes made by AI.
